## How to use this repository

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/haskell-competitive-programming
   cd haskell-competitive-programming
```

2. **Choose a problem** from one of the difficulty categories.

3. **Run the solution**: Each problem solution is written as a Haskell source file. You can run the code using ghc (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) or load it into ghci (the interactive Haskell interpreter).

To compile and run a file:

```bash
   ghc ProblemName.hs
   ./ProblemName
```

Or, run it in ghci:

```bash
    ghci ProblemName.hs
```

4. **Modify and Experiment*: You are encouraged to modify the solutions, experiment with different test cases, and try alternative approaches.
